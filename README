Slimtimer4j client
========================================================================

A basic library to support the slimtimer.com API - at its most basic:

SlimTimer timer = new SlimTimer("user","pass","apiKey");
List<Task> tasks = timer.getAllTasks();

See SlimTimerClient.java for a more comprehensive set of features available (pretty
much whatever the slimtimer API provides, this library provides access to it).

This library does have some dependencies - see the pom.xml for details.


========================================================================
Building:
========================================================================

You can build the jar itself:

mvn clean install

You can build a binary script that demos the features:

mvn package appassembler:assemble -DapiKey=<your api key> -Duser=<your user> -Dpassword=<your password>
sh target/appassembler/bin/slimtimer4j

- more examples
- convenience methods to filter TimeEntries by their status (ie fine current active entries easily).
